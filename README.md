# Drawboard for Rocket League

This is a virtual drawboard with the Rocket League field template (top view) and other (2D) objects from the game.

Useful for coaching and illustrating tactics and specific plays.

## How to use

Download the files, open *../drawboard-rl/drawboard/index.html'* on Firefox or Microsoft Edge and you are good to go.
Chrome does not load local images, so you need to host the files in a local/online server and open the tool from there.

More instructions shown on screen after opening the tool.
