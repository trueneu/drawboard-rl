# Drawboard for Rocket League

This is a virtual drawboard with the Rocket League field template (top view) and other (2D) objects from the game.

Useful for coaching and illustrating tactics and specific plays.

## How to use

Download the files, open the *index.html* file with Firefox or Microsoft Edge and you are good to go.

If you want to use with Chrome, it won't load local images so you will need to host the files in a local/online server and open the tool from there.

More instructions shown on screen after opening the tool.

## Build with

[P5.js](https://p5js.org/) - JavaScript library.
